NuCommander aims to be a fast small orthodox file manager, with
emphasis on a keyboard driven user interface.

Download the latest release tarball. Unpack the tarball to a directory
of your choice and then in the directory run the following commands:

This will install NuCommander to the /usr/local prefix, you can
specify a different prefix with the `--prefix=<prefix>` option to
`./configure`.

version lacks some important features and may contain bugs.
